# Password Checker
Implementations of a hashtable and a binary search tree, used for checking passwords, created as part of my data structures course at San Diego State University
NOTE: 
      Main is in Assign4.java and still needs to be fixed, it takes two command line arguments which should be an input file and an output file, the input file should be a list of passwords
      UnitTests todo: encorporate JUnit, and make the tests a little more robust
